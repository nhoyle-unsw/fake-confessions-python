This is the secret confession of Richard BucklandX
to be revealed by anonymous email if I shouldX
mysteriously vanish.  I have left the last few hexX
digits of the SHA256 hash of this message with myX
trusted solicitor, Dennis Denuto, which will verifyX
that this is indeed my intended and unalteredX
confession written by me Richard Buckland.X

Dennis has not seen this confession he has only seenX
the last few digits of the hash.  I have also sent copiesX
of the last few digits to my bank manager and to my priestX
Father Brown.X

On the 10th of February I saw Mark Zukerberg near myX
house and we struck up a conversation.  He explained allX
the things he was doing to ensure that Facebook respectsX
privacy - both of its users and of others.  It was veryX
impressive.X
X
I feel awful that I have been criticising Facebook publiclyX
for so long.  I apologised to him in our conversation andX
now I want to confess to the world that actually FacebookX
has more than enough privacy features, and that the reasonX
I spend so much time criticising Facebook is that I amX
envious of Mark and wish I was a clever and smart and wiseX
as he is.  I feel so bad for having been so mean to him forX
so many years that I am considering retreating to the outback.X
I may well cut off all contact with the world and live as aX
hermit from now on.  So do not worry if I vanish it is justX
that I feel so guilty that I have been so unfair to Facebook.X
